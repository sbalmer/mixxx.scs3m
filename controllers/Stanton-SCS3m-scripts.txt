Mixxx Stanton SCS.3m guide
==========================

Work in progress. Improvements and suggestions to the guide and the mapping itself are welcome.

The mapping should be pretty straightforward, only the alternate modes are
explained here.



Deck switching buttons
----------------------

When touching the "A C" or "B D" buttons, the mixer switches between decks.
On the left side, touching "A C" will switch between decks 1 and 3. On the right
side, touching "B D" will switch between decks 2 and 4. All controls except for
the crossfader then control the selected deck.



Holding FX
----------

FX is employed as a "mode"-button and connects alternate controls. It affects
only the side where it is held. Controls that change:
Gain slider: controls channel pre-gain in relative mode
Buttons: The four buttons toggle assignement to FX chains (See FX modes)
Crossfader: Needle drop, absolute jump to the track location where you touch the crossfader


EQ mode
-------

This is the standard mixing mde where the three EQ sliders control low/mid/high.
The top slider controls the filter knob.

Holding EQ and touching a slider will reset it to its preset position. (Unfortunately this doesn't work yet for FX and MASTER modes.)


FX modes
--------

When one of the four buttons to the side of the gain slider is touched, the EQ-
sliders control the selected effect chain. Top button selects first effect chain
and so forth. In this mode, the EQ sliders control the first three knobs of the
first effect in the selected effect chain. The top slider controls dry/wet mix.


MASTER mode
-----------

When holding the central MASTER button, the left side controls the headphone
channel, while the right side controls the master channel.
Left top slider: Pre/main mix on headphone
Right top slider: main balance
Left slider: head gain
Right slider: master gain
